permutive bespoke digital stickers

We use these to celebrate people, in the absence of a genuine round of applause in real life and a physical sticker to say 'well done'.

This repo is literally just a place to save these images so that we can throw them in slack and they'll autoexpand. Somehow google drive won't do this for me.
